I am a Ph.D. student of [HISLab](https://his-lab.org)@[POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr).
My research interests include accessibility, gamification, location-based games, and LLMs.
I've attended [CHI 2024](https://chi2024.acm.org) and [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org), which were meaningful experiences for me.
