## Overview

A vocabulary learning platform that combines a Chrome Extension for word collection with a web application for systematic study. Save unfamiliar words while browsing, then review them using spaced repetition algorithms.

## Features

### Word Collection
Right-click any word on any webpage to save it instantly through the Chrome Extension. Words are saved with their context for better retention.

### Study Mode
Flashcard-based learning system implementing spaced repetition algorithms. Cards show the word first, then reveal definitions and example sentences.

### Progress Tracking
Visual dashboards display daily progress, study streaks, and learning statistics to help monitor improvement over time.

### Word Groups
Organize vocabulary into thematic groups for focused study sessions. Each group can be studied independently.

### IPA Pronunciation
International Phonetic Alphabet notation provided for accurate pronunciation learning.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Extension**: Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for containerized deployment

### Key Components
- Spaced repetition algorithm for optimal review scheduling
- Real-time synchronization between extension and web app
- Responsive design supporting desktop and mobile browsers
- Dark mode support for reduced eye strain

## Usage Flow

1. Install the Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store
2. Create an account on the web application
3. Save words by right-clicking while browsing
4. Review saved words in the web app's study mode
5. Track progress through the dashboard

## Development Notes

The project addresses the gap between word collection tools (which lack study features) and vocabulary apps (which make adding words cumbersome). By integrating both aspects, it creates a seamless learning workflow.

The spaced repetition implementation uses a modified SM-2 algorithm, adjusting review intervals based on user performance. This ensures efficient memorization without overwhelming users with too many reviews.
